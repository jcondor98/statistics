Gregorius looked ahead at the pointed towers of the Historical Museum of the
City of Bern, up to the Gurten and down to the Aare with its glacier green
water. A gusty wind drove low-lying clouds over him, turned his umbrella inside
out and whipped the rain in his face. Now he noticed the woman in the middle of
the bridge. She had leaned her elbows on the railing and was reading in the
pouring rain what looked like a letter.
